From my time in college, I noticed that Bates (and perhaps other schools) could offer their students a more efficient manner to access
information on campus and complete certain tasks which were reminiscent of non-DRY code in real life. 
Enter 'BatesBWell' which takes its name after the fitness program for faculty and staff on campus called B-Well.
The features comprised in this application are:
* automatic attendance tracker
* dining menu viewer

Say you are tired of manually logging in students or maintaining standard roll call attendance.
